In this post I will be talking about my interview experiences, not about how to crack these interviews but about how I felt about the interview process of two companies and how different they were. This is purely based on what I observed and on my opinions. 

<h1 class="post-subheading">Interview at InMobi</h1>

InMobi is a younger company, having been founded in 2007. It specialises in monetizing apps and for a young company, does surprisingly well, being inline with Googles's Adsense and Facebook.

The interview process for InMobi consisted of

    - An online coding round
    - Two technical rounds
    - lastly a HR round

The online coding round was three questions and about 10 questions about data structures and algorithms.

The next two technical rounds included algorithm based questions, two per round and questions regarding my resume.

In the end was the HR round where we discussed more about my projects in my resume. 


<h1 class="post-subheading">Interview at Microsoft</h1>

Let's skip the introduction for this company and let's just dive into it. 

The interview process for Microsoft had

    - An online coding test :- a pretty good number of studenrs write this, approximately 10 students
    - A group fly round :- Mine came in the north-west region. Roughly 300 students were present in this stage.
    - The final interview :- approximately 20-30 students were selected for this. which durther had
        - 3 technical rounds
        - A HR round

The online coding test had three  questions. You would be expected to do all three to qualify for the next round

The group fly round where in you would be required to code up solutions to two questions. Once again you would be required to solve all of them to qualify (this pretty much applies to all rounds)

Next came the three technical interviews, each was based on two algorithm questions and one question which you would have to code up. 

The final round was the HR round


<h1 class="post-subheading">The differences and similarities</h1>

A similarity which both them show is the key emphasis in data structures and algorithms, rather than emphasis on the field (job profile) itself. Although personally I feel the former is a better way of judging because they do test a person's problem solvong skills, whether it is actually the better way is something we can debate about it. In short this can be compared to other companies. 

One difference was the attention to my resume. Although InMobi was very much interested in understanding my previous experiemce and project work, Microsoft seemed to care less about it.
